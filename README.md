I write progressive web apps using:
- [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) ([Crostini](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux)/[Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/features), [Neon](https://neon.kde.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/en/), & [etc.](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/))
- [Go](https://go.dev/) (aka [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers#united-states), [100K+ github stars](https://github.com/golang/go), [Chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp), [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit))
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) ([Primeng](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/setup) & [Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) Components)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) (using [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) driver)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([Node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) & [Postgresql](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) images)

These are just my humble work-in-progress personal notes that I share with teammates. Interspersed might be some opinions in IT. I like to say positive things about my IT experience in spite of actual experience. It is a better world that way.

The required spectrum of knowledge in application software development is staggeringly humbling. I like to highlight the painful basic fundamentals in app development.

I'm a bit of a minimalist.  <ins>***I love the command line!***</ins>  Here you will not find the use of fancy GUI tools with drag-and-drop and point-and-click. I like building those in the apps I write but for app development I am attracted to simple reliable tools.

The command line interface (cli) is easy. I simply keep a text file with all my often-used long commands (e.g., new go version install, docker runs, volume mounts, ssh connects, & etc.). I may edit them then copy from my editor with ***ctrl-c*** then paste them with ***ctrl-shift-v*** into the terminal. It is still dealing with text and so is not a jarring change of context from dealing with text in source code.

The following list will become links to small projects in this repo as I go along. I am in the process of extracting and simplifying relevant code from projects I have done. This list may change according to my interests.

1. [Dockerize your Angular dev environment](https://github.com/cydriclopez/docker-ng-dev)
2. [Dockerize your PostgreSQL dev environment](https://github.com/cydriclopez/docker-pg-dev)

3. [Feed JSON data to a tree component](https://github.com/cydriclopez/treemodule-json)
4. [Write a Go static file web server](https://github.com/cydriclopez/go-static-server)

5. Go POST JSON passthru controller
6. Parse JSON in PostgreSQL to save records

7. Generate JSON data from PostgreSQL
8. Simple Go web app structure

9. Fast encrypted backup system using [gocryptfs](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/) and [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
10. Setup a [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) & [Buildbot](https://www.buildbot.net/) CI/CD system

More to come...

Thanks for reading & have a great day! ðŸ™‚

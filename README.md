> *If only I knew what I don't.*


I write progressive web apps using:
- Linux (Crostini-Debian, Ubuntu, Neon, Fedora, & etc.)
- Go (Golang)
- Angular (Primeng & Material Components)
- Postgresql (using pgx driver)
- Python (Beautiful Soup)
- Docker (Nodejs & Postgresql images)

These are just my humble work-in-progress personal notes that I share with teammates. Interspersed might be some opinions in IT. I like to say positive things about my IT experience in spite of actual experience. It is a better world that way.

The required spectrum of knowledge in application software development is staggeringly humbling. I like to highlight the painful basic fundamentals in app development.

I'm a bit of a minimalist.  <ins>***I love the command line!***</ins>  Here you will not find the use of fancy GUI tools with drag-and-drop and point-and-click. I like building those in the apps I write but for app development I am attracted to simple reliable tools.

The following list will become links to small projects in this repo as I go along. I am in the process of extracting and simplifying relevant code from projects I have done.

1. Dockerize your Angular dev environment
2. Dockerize your PostgreSQL dev environment

3. IT hiring is bananas
4. Feed JSON data to a tree component

5. Write a Go static file web server
6. IT pain is rampant

7. Go POST JSON passthru controller
8. Parse JSON in PostgreSQL to save records

9. Generate JSON data from PostgreSQL
10. My LSD addiction (No! It's not what you think!)

11. Fast encrypted backup system using gocryptfs and rsync
12. Setup a Gitea-Buildbot CI/CD system

More to come...

Thanks for reading & have a great day! ðŸ™‚
